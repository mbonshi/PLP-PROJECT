    <p >The Copperbelt Province is one of the 10 provinces found in Zambia. The name Copperbelt is derived from the copper mining activities that have been associated with the area since the pre-colonial and post-independence Zambia. The activities have for years designed Copperbelt as an economic hub of the nation, with the dawn of economic diversification as a national agenda. Copperbelt is endeavoring to promote tourism as an economic activity that is able to contribute to sustainable livelihoods of Zambians.    </p>
    <p>The average rainfall patterns are normal to above normal ranging from 1200mm and above.

      Natural resources consist of Wildlife/ Bird sanctuary, Forest, arable land, copper, emerald and other minerals.
      
      The Kafue River is the only major river found in the province. In addition, the province has twenty four tributary streams that feed into the Kafue River, 4 of which are perennial and a large number of the remainder being near perennial. It flows through the Province in a wide current and enters Central Province near Lukanga Swamps. There are several sites for large dams on the Kafue River. In addition tributary streams on the Copperbelt offer 100 dam sites of 250,000,000 litre capacity.
      
      Underground water is normally obtainable with little difficulty, particularly around “Dambos”. Strong springs and artesian wells are rare.</p>
